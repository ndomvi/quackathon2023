# How to pay off loans
## Paying the minimum payments on all loans
 You should always prioritise paying the minimum payments, if there are any. This should be done before paying off other debt.  
 Not paying minimum payments will incur late fees, which will make you owe more money.
## Highest rate first
  When paying debt it is importatn to prioritise debts with the highest interest rate, no matter how big or small it is.  
  The debts with high interest rates are accruing the most interest over time. By paying them off early, you save money in the long term.
